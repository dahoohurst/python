TITLE: THIS LIFE I LIVE

2
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:27.000
This life I live is not my own

3
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.000
For my Redeemer paid the price

4
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:38.000
He took it to be His alone

5
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.000
To be His treasure and His prize

6
00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:49.000
The things of earth I leave behind

7
00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.000
To live in worship of my King

8
00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:00.000
His is the right to rule my life

9
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:13.000
Mine is the joy to live for Him

10
00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:18.000
I died to sin upon the cross

11
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:24.000
I'm bound to Jesus in His death

12
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.000
The old is gone and now I must

13
00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:35.000
Rely on Him for ev'ry breath

14
00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.000
With ev'ry footstep that I tread

15
00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.000
What mysteries He has in store

16
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:51.000
I cannot know what lies ahead

17
00:01:51.000 --> 00:02:04.000
But know that He has gone before

18
00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:09.000
There is a voice that pierced the grave

19
00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:15.000
A power that rolled the stone away

20
00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:20.000
A sound of life I know I'm saved

21
00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:26.000
The voice of God has called my name

22
00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:31.000
So I will rise and in the air

23
00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:37.000
Behold the glory of the King

24
00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:42.000
I will not fear to meet Him there

25
00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:47.000
I know my life is hid with Him
